## A brief description of the data
Each '_graph.txt' file contains a graph that can be read by Networx library on python. These graphs are parsed (with 'graph_parser' script) members of communities on Russian social network Vk.com of theaters.
Nodes represent followers of a community and edges - the friendship among them. So, two nodes are connected when they are in a friends list of each other.

## Description of the project
There are three main sections of analysis: 
1. Single graph (Moscow operetta) exploration to find common patters and get an overview how a community graph looks like.
2. Comparative analysis of all parsed graphs
3. Demonstration of the heuristic algorithms to find optimal agents for spreading rumors or maximizing "word of mouth" effect. For more details, please, read [our work](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive).
